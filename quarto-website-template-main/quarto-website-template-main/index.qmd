# Welcome to my website!

My name is Trisha Lal. I am a third-year General Surgery resident at Case Western Reserve/University Hospitals. My future aspirations involve a career in academic surgical oncology. In order to achieve this goal, I am dedicating two additional years of residency to academic development time after my second clinical year so that I can develop a prolific research portfolio and be a competitive applicant for fellowship.

As a medical student at Howard University College of Medicine, a historically black college/university, completing my clinical rotations during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic brought the alarming healthcare disparities that my patients to the foreground. I learned how to be a compassionate and culturally competent physician in that environment, and I aim to carry that with me throughout my career. 

I started my academic development time in July 2024 and have hit the ground running. My primary mentor is Dr. Richard Hoehn, an academic surgical oncologist at UH who shares my passion for health equity. We have been working on various projects involving topics like financial toxicity, social vulnerability, and barriers to cancer care. Additionally, I am pursuing a Master's in Clinical Research through Case Western Reserve University during this time in order to solidify my foundation in health services research. 

Outside of work, I enjoy cooking, painting, yoga, and running. I love to travel and hope to do more of it during this two-year hiatus. I'm also a big Celtics fan, fortunately. 

On this website, you will find a list of my current research projects, as well as information on upcoming events and conferences where I will be speaking. I invite you to explore my website and learn more about me!

Please feel free to [contact me](mailto:trisha.lal@uhhospitals.org) if you have any questions or would like to discuss potential projects.
