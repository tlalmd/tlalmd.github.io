I just published a manuscript on the incidence portion of this project in Cancers. Now that that has been completed, I plan on moving on to the second part of the project, which involves learning how to do survival analyses and other appropriate statistical tests. I will aggregate that work into a second manuscript, which will likely continue into early 2025."

    "text": "The Association between Social Vulnerability and the Incidence of Early vs. Late-Stage Melanoma\nThis is one of my first clinical research projects. I am currently writing a manuscript based on my analyses and aim to have it submitted by the end of October 2024. Once that is completed, I have ideas for several other projects stemming from this overarching topic: geospatial analyses of this subject across various geographic regions in the US, classification and regression tree analysis to determine susceptible phenotypes, and evaluation of other melanoma risk factors on early- vs. late-stage disease incidence."

    "text": "Provider Perceptions of Barriers to Care for GI Cancer Patients\nThis project started this past summer with a survey sent to various healthcare providers caring for patients with GI cancers at UH. There was an excellent response rate, which has led me to be able to conduct thorough descriptive statistical analyses of the results. I am working on generating a manuscript that summarizes our findings. The following steps will include conducting provider interviews to build on our survey data and eventual patient interviews to understand both perspectives better. This will require several more rounds of analysis and manuscript writing. Additionally, I aim to present this work at various conferences along the way, ranging from UH Research and Innovation Day this October to the ASCO GI symposium in January 2025 to the annual Health Disparities Symposium held at UH in 2026. My ultimate goal is to be able to bring our findings to administrative staff at UH to implement specific policy changes to mitigate barriers as perceived by providers and patients.\n\nView the tutorial for this template (+ download link)"

I am a third-year General Surgery resident at Case Western Reserve/University Hospitals. My future aspirations involve a career in academic surgical oncology. In order to achieve this goal, I am dedicating two additional years of residency to academic development time after my second clinical year so that I can develop a prolific research portfolio and be a competitive applicant for fellowship.\nAs a medical student at Howard University College of Medicine, a historically black college/university, completing my clinical rotations during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic brought the alarming healthcare disparities that my patients to the foreground. I learned how to be a compassionate and culturally competent physician in that environment, and I aim to carry that with me throughout my career.\nI started my academic development time in July 2024 and have hit the ground running. My primary mentor is Dr. Richard Hoehn, an academic surgical oncologist at UH who shares my passion for health equity. We have been working on various projects involving topics like financial toxicity, social vulnerability, and barriers to cancer care. Additionally, I am pursuing a Master’s in Clinical Research through Case Western Reserve University during this time in order to solidify my foundation in health services research.\nOutside of work, I enjoy cooking, painting, yoga, and running. I love to travel and hope to do more of it during this two-year hiatus. I’m also a big Celtics fan, fortunately.\nOn this website, you will find a list of my current research projects, as well as information on upcoming events and conferences where I will be speaking. I invite you to explore my website and learn more about me!\nPlease feel free to contact me if you have any questions or would like to discuss potential projects.\n\nView the tutorial for this template (+ download link)"
